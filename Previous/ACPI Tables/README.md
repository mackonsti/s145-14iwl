# Dumped ACPI Tables

The following files (in a `zip` container) represent the dumped ACPI Tables from the respective BIOS version. The tool used was Clover, during the boot selection stage (via **F4** on the keyboard).

The main `DSDT.aml` file for each BIOS version is also disassembled via `iasl` command (in Terminal) for reference and study.
